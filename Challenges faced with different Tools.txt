Microsoft SQl Manageement Studio: 

- Initially loaded the Developer version than realized we just need the Basic/Express version.
Had to uninstall & reload again.

1. Firstly converted xls to csv with comma delimiter.
2. Then database, task, file.
3. gave an below error : Sol - changed the nvarchar(1) to nvarchar(50) - For a bunch of columns.

Error inserting data into table. (Microsoft.SqlServer.Import.Wizard)
The given value '8200' of type String from the data source cannot be converted to type 
nvarchar for Column 11 [total_vaccinations]. (Microsoft.Data.SqlClient)
String or binary data would be truncated in table '[dbo].[CovidVaccinations]', 
column 'total_vaccinations'. Truncated value: '8'. (Microsoft.Data.SqlClient)

4. Continent column had blanks/nulls. So updated them for now manually.
Also had the name of continent in the location field (data Aggeragation maybe).

New Concepts:
**** CTE, Cast, Partition, over, 



Excel Notes
Tried to merge the longitude sheet with Covid deaths using Data Formulas, did not work as the countries are repeated
It only works on a unique. Did a right join in AWS Quicksight.

*** The dataset did not have US states to generate a US region map. 

So try to use SQL merge & creating a temporary view. 
**** Did a join in Microsoft Studio - Need to figure out how to export to an Xls file from the temporary view. 

Tableau - 
- Figuring out which version was available/which one we can use & the actual installing took some time.
- The generation of the region map file pictorials were easy as compared to AwS Quiksight graphs as I 
had to join & build the Geopatial files manually which took some time.
